SHELLING TODO
--------------------------------
- make mene scalable
- add instructions to BappDesc.html
- more automation (Scanner integration?), includig payload marking, so multiple scans can be queued
- support for manually provided arguments (e.g. ARGUMENT_SEPARATOR-c1 for ping on nix, so the additional argument is handled consistently with the currently used separator)
- it would be nice to make the tool more configurable:
 - so users could choose the basic patterns (final payload number optimization, e.g. levels 'superficial', 'profound', 'paranoid' like 'risk' in sqlmap, for example IMHO not-prefixed patterns are redundant - this would significantly reduce the current high number of payloads)

Nice-to-haves:

- argument injection:
	 - think of introducing argument injection mode (recent Dawid's RCEs :D)
	 - add/mention the >file case :)
- introduce terminal injection payloads (escape sequences) like this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33504/
- windows stuff:
	 - additional argument separators for windows: ;-_,=/ (find out compatible commands, as echo/type are fine, while ping fails)
	 - THERE IS NO SLEEP IN WINDOWS! must use ping, although this will complicate things, as ping requires argument separators
- sort the output payloads by starting with the ones most likely to work
- make payload profiles, e.g. nospace to focus on no-space only
- also, consider injections into sh expressions
